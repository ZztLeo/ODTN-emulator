# Swagger Jersey generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
http://localhost:1234/swagger.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!

## Notifications
The codes is generated automatically as listed:

    Thanks to my colleague Diego we have been able to generate a Java Server Stub to be use for testing ODTN Phase 1.5 prototypes. As you might know the generated code is “empty” in the sense that it does not returns any TAPI objects when the different API entries are exercise by a REST Client app, currently the expected answer from any TAPI request is:
     
    {"code":4,"type":"ok","message":"magic!"}
     
    Following I explain the whole process employed to generate this server as I think it would be interesting to be included in a README file if we want to upload it to the official repositories.
     
    Starting from the official ONF TAPI 2.1 yang models we have generated the conversion to swagger using the following command:
     
    sudo java -jar ~/.m2/repository/com/mrv/yangtools/swagger-generator-cli/1.1.11-SNAPSHOT/swagger-generator-cli-1.1.11-SNAPSHOT-executable.jar -yang-dir YANG/ -format json -content-type application/json -output tapi-2.1.json tapi-topology tapi-common tapi-connectivity tapi-dsr tapi-eth tapi-notification tapi-oam tapi-path-computation tapi-photonic-media tapi-virtual-network
     
    Subsequently I generated the server stub using the swagger-codegen-2.3.1 software downloaded from:
     
    wget http://central.maven.org/maven2/io/swagger/swagger-codegen-cli/2.3.1/swagger-codegen-cli-2.3.1.jar -O swagger-codegen-cli.jar
     
    Then we generated the server stub on Java JAX-RS (Jersey) using the following command:
     
    java -jar swagger-codegen-cli-2.3.1.jar generate -i tapi-2.1.json -l jaxrs -o tapi2.1-javaServer
     
    However it seems this latest versión of swagger-codegen has a bug (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/swagger-swaggersocket/qceUgy2kpGQ) which we solved by removing the following line from the pom.xml included in the root folder of the generated server stub.
     
        <dependency>
        	<groupId>javax.validation</groupId>
        	<artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>
        	<version>1.1.0.Final</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
     
    After this little modification the server stub is ready to be launched by:
     
    mvn clean package jetty:run
    
    
    Make sure of these conditions
    I setup a new VM Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, I simply installed the openjdk-8-jdk, then the latest maven package:
     
    /tapi2.1-javaServer$ mvn -v
    Apache Maven 3.3.9
    Maven home: /usr/share/maven
    Java version: 1.8.0_181, vendor: Oracle Corporation
    Java home: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre
    Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
    OS name: "linux", version: "4.13.0-36-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
     
    And then I simply unzip the java server stub file “tapi2.1.zip” and I could get the server properly running by compiling and executing the server with:
     
    mvn clean package jetty:run


1. Some Restful Response are filled in class `DataApiServiceImpl`;

2. In order to match the namespace prefix definition, some URIs defined in class `DataApi` are replaced:

| Auto-generated | replaced |
| ---- | ---- |
| context | tapi-common:context |
| media-channel-service-interface-point-spec | tapi-photonic-media:media-channel-service-interface-point-spec |
| connectivity-service | tapi-connectivity:connectivity-service |

3. The response json should also contains the namespace prefix as 2. mentioned. 
For device/port discovery, all Java annotations `@JsonProperty("media-channel-service-interface-point-spec")`
are replaced by `@JsonProperty("tapi-photonic-media:media-channel-service-interface-point-spec")`
