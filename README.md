# ODTN-emulator
There are two kinds of emulators, i.e., the OpenConfig model under directory [emulator-oc-cassini](emulator-oc-cassini) and the TAPI model under directory [emulator-tapi-2.1](emulator-tapi-2.1). The former describes the line-side and client-side of the terminal device in Open Line System (OLS), and the latter describes the middle components between optical device in OLS.
