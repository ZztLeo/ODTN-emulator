  description
   "A wavelength channel is characterized by a wavelength band having a start 
    and end frequency. Once provisioned, this channel can have information 
    reported about it like optical power. Also, this channel is what is 
    switched at a ROADM node.
 
    A monitored-channel is a wavelength channel that can also support raising of
    alarms when optical powers cross provisioned thresholds.

    The named-monitored-channels list and the monitored-channels list are
    two ways to represent monitored channels. The unnamed monitored-channel is
    used in fixed-grid products where channels are statically defined. 
    named-monitored-channels are used in flexible grid products where channels 
    are dynamically provisioned. A product would support one of these lists, not
    both.

    A channel can contain sub-channels (carriers) within it that are not 
    switchable. The support for carriers is indicated by the multi-carrier
    feature.
